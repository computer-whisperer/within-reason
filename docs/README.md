Six kinds of knowledge with different lifetimes. Put a fact where its lifetime says it belongs.

| Where | What | Changes when |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge/` | Claims about the game and opponents, each with evidence and a status | every batch can support, weaken or retire one |
| `heuristics.md` | Registry of the brain's rules: ID, code location, the claims it rests on, status | a rule is added, changed or retired |
| `experiments.md` | Ledger of arena batches: label, commit, setup, result, what it was testing | every batch |
| `studies/` | Offline studies (simulation, data analysis) with their data; findings enter `knowledge/` as `conjectured` until the arena tests them | a study is added or rerun |
| `design/` | Target designs written before a large change, dated: what is true today, the design, how it will be judged, and a status line kept current while it is built. Decisions move into `DESIGN.md` once built | a multi-part arc starts, or its status changes |
| `briefs/` | What an LLM player is told at the start of a session, distilled from `knowledge/` with each line naming its entries; compiled into the bot (`briefs/commander.md` follows the commander's role prompt) | a claim it cites changes status, or a game shows the model missing or misusing something |
| `harness/` | Engine, AI interface, lobby, arena and tooling facts | rarely; on engine or game bumps |

`../DESIGN.md` is the architecture (shim, protocol, bot process). It records decisions, not findings.

## The loop
1. **Observe.** Run a batch. Compare wins against losses using the per-minute status lines in `bot.log`
   (and, once rule-firing logs exist, which heuristics fired).
2. **Claim.** Write what you think is true as a knowledge entry with status `conjectured`, citing batch, match and frame.
   A claim must be checkable: say what observation would prove it wrong.
3. **Exploit.** Add or change a heuristic. Give it an ID, register it in `heuristics.md` with the claims it rests on.
4. **Verify.** Run a batch that could show the change did nothing. Record it in `experiments.md`.
   Move the claim to `supported`, or to `refuted` with the evidence. 12 matches is noise-level (±14 points); confirm with 24+.
5. **Retire.** When a claim stops holding (new opponent tier, new map, our own play changed the situation), mark it
   `retired` with the reason and retire or rewrite the heuristics that cite it. Never delete entries: why something stopped
   being true is knowledge.

Rules of the road: a heuristic without a registered claim is a guess — register the guess as `conjectured`. A batch without a
ledger line did not happen. Results that contradict a `supported` claim reopen it; say so in the entry rather than quietly
tuning around it.

**Reviewing a game** (step 1 of the loop, one match at a time): the `bar-review` skill (`.claude/skills/bar-review/SKILL.md`,
a subagent given a match directory) reads the record, the pianist's log, the transcript and the truth file through the
`run/` tools, holds the game against the high-OS replay baselines (`.claude/skills/bar-review/baselines.md`) and writes
`review.md` (findings ranked by cost, each with its clock, its evidence and the baseline it falls short of; what a
stronger player would have done; the player, the hands, the harness) and `verdict.json` (`harness/verdicts.md`, the
shape `run/tally_verdicts.py` adds up) into the match directory. The checklist grows with every packet of feedback
from experienced players (the skill's last section; the notes themselves go to `knowledge/_inbox/player-notes.md`).
The study behind it: `studies/2026-09-27-review-skill.md`.
