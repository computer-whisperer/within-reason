# Arena — batch evaluation

`target/release/arena [--matches N] [--parallel N] [--speed N] [--realtime] [--profile easy|medium|hard|hard_aggressive] [--map NAME]
[--max-minutes N] [--label TEXT] [--base-port N] [--think-cap S] [--turn-limit S]`

Per match: a directory `run/matches/<unix-stamp>-<label>/NN/` holding `script.txt`, `engine.log`, `bot.log`, the match record
`record-<ai_id>.jsonl` (`record-format.md`; open it with `run/view_match.py`, which browses every batch, or `run/view_match.py <match dir>`), the replay under `demos/`, and the engine's write-dir litter; `results.jsonl` per batch. The arena rebuilds and reinstalls the AI first
(`run/install_ai.sh`), starts one bot and one engine per match with a private socket and ports `9100 + 2*index`, requests
the speed over the autohost channel, reads the winner from SERVER_GAMEOVER, and ends the engine with `/kill`.
- Two arenas on one machine need separate port ranges: give the second `--base-port 9300` (match i uses N+2i, N+2i+1).
  Without it the second arena's matches fail to bind the autohost port of the first.
- Start box and faction alternate by match index; the opponent gets the other faction, or ours with `--mirror`.
- After a batch the arena prints mean heuristic firings per match for wins against losses (from the `rules:` lines in
  `bot.log`) and a ledger row for `docs/experiments.md`; `batch.json` records label, commit and options.
- `game_minutes` is read from the last `[f=N]` in the engine log after exit.
- Timeout is game time: the shim prints `heartbeat f=N` once per game minute into the engine log and the arena stops the
  match at `--max-minutes` (default 40). A 120 s wall-clock stall allowance is the backstop.
- Refuses to start if `--parallel` x 4 GB exceeds available memory (a 24-way run once took ~100 GB).
- Throughput on the 24-core machine BEFORE the efficiency changes below: a lone match sustains ~35x at requested 50-80; 8 parallel ~10x each
  (8 matches: 3m06s wall, 28 min user + 6.5 min system CPU). ~2.5-3 cores per match.

Reading a match: `grep " min) \|attackers \|wave " NN/bot.log` gives the per-minute economy line, attacker centroid and
wave launches. Comparing those lines between a win and a loss found every bug so far.

## Efficiency (2026-09-19; measured by a research agent, then verified with arena batches)
Every match dir is seeded from `run/match-template/` and, when present, `run/cache-template/` (untracked, refreshed after each batch).
| Change | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `WorkerThreadCount = 1` | template `springsettings.cfg` | the default 12-thread pool is a net loss even for one match: idle workers spin on futexes (`ThreadPool.cpp:248-266`); per match to 12 game-min, 8 parallel: 25.7 s / 41.8 user / 15.4 sys -> 13.6 s / 16.0 / 0.5 |
| `UseLuaMemPools = 0`, `TextureMemPoolSize = 256` | same | peak RSS per engine 5.3 GB -> 3.3 GB (64 segfaults, 128 ran); ~7% slower play |
| archive cache pre-seeded | `run/cache-template/` | skips ~3 s of checksumming per match |
| `GameStartDelay=0` | start script | skips a 4 s countdown |
| quit widget | template `LuaUI/Widgets/arena_quit.lua` | client exits ~2.6 s after game over instead of waiting for BAR's 12 s autoquit |
| all stock widgets disabled | template `LuaUI/Config/BYAR.lua` | ~5% play time, -170 MB, no GL error noise; regenerate the list when the game adds widgets |
Verified end to end: 12 matches, 8 parallel, speed 50 now cost 16.5 min user + 0.4 min sys CPU (was 28 + 6.5 for 8 matches)
with results in line with earlier batches (eff-speed50: 8-3-1; eff-speed50-par12: 5-6-1).
Did not matter: demo recording, sound, logging, core pinning (`taskset` was slower), `ServerSleepTime`, `PathingThreadCount`.
Remaining load time (~7-10 s) is pathfinder init, LuaRules, LuaUI parsing, atlases; no headless switch found. The static
~1.7 GB memory floor is compiled-in pools.

**OPEN — requested speed changes outcomes.** `--speed 200 --parallel 12` gave 1-5-6 (eff-applied) where `--speed 50` gives the
usual ~58% at both 8 and 12 parallel. Games ran long and both sides developed slowly. Cause unknown; candidates: BARb's
threaded planning runs on wall-clock time, or our tick round-trip falls behind when frames are not paced (at a capped speed
the client sleeps between frames, `Game.cpp:1825-1835`). Until explained, evaluate at `--speed 50` (the default) and never
compare batches run at different requested speeds.

## Watching the opponent

The arena sets `WITHIN_REASON_OBSERVE=1` for every match (since 2026-09-20; before, the caller had to). It makes the shim write a census of both sides to `engine.log` once a game minute (unit types,
counts, mean positions). It switches the engine's cheat callbacks on for the length of that one query only; the bot's own
view stays fair. `run/compare_census.py run/matches/<batch>/<NN> [--detail MINUTE]` prints the two sides beside each other.
`--corner nw|se` fixes our start (`nw` is the first start box of the layout: W on Comet Catcher, N on Quicksilver); `--swap-corners` puts ally team 0 in the second box.

Team games: `--ours N --allies N --enemies N` (seats of ours, BARb seats on our side, BARb seats against us; default 1 0 1),
`--ffa` (every enemy seat its own ally team; at most 3, and the map must have boxes for that many), `--boxes
standard|corners|north-south|west-east`. `standard` (the default since 2026-09-20) takes the lobby's saved boxes for the map
and the number of ally teams from `crates/arena/startboxes.dat`, a copy of BYAR-Chobby's `savedBoxes.dat`: on Comet Catcher
two full-height 20 % strips (W against E), on Quicksilver two full-width strips (N 31.5 % against S 25 %). Every batch
before rush-7 ran on `corners` (30 % squares), which leaves out most of the strip's extractor clusters (7 of a Comet
strip's 14 spots) and is not the players' layout. Where the game puts an AI in a box is its own guess: in Comet's strips
BARb (and we, without `--place`) spawn diagonally, SW (1286, 5421) against NE (6899, 681). Allies share a start box and the game places them in it. An
allied BARb plays the other faction. One bot process serves all our seats of a match, one session each, joined by the
team board (`crates/bot/src/team.rs`); each seat writes its own `record-<ai>.jsonl`. A human ally cannot be scripted
headless; an allied BARb is the same code path for us. The referee's balance line counts our whole ally team against every enemy.
`--player` gives our seats one LLM session between them (transcript `strategist-<first seat's ai>.jsonl`);
`--commander-model claude-opus-5-5` replaces the player's usual model. (The commander and strategist modes were deleted
2026-09-25, `docs/design/2026-09-25-one-decider.md`.) `fw:<model id>` runs the player on Fireworks.ai and `api:<model>` on any OpenAI-compatible endpoint through the bot's own API client (`docs/harness/api-backend.md`: the key file, the turn shape, the transcript).

## Post-game analysis

With `WITHIN_REASON_OBSERVE=1` the shim also writes `truth-<ai>.jsonl` into the match directory: every enemy unit
(`[id, name, x, z, health %, being built]`) every two seconds, read through the engine's cheat callbacks switched on for
that one query. It is for analysis only; the bot never sees it.

Controlling for the opponent: BARb's profile is the only choice the lobby offers, but within a profile its first
factory varies (bot lab or vehicle plant) and with it the whole game (K-barb-opening-varies). `--opponent-opening
bots|vehicles` pins it; with `WITHIN_REASON_OBSERVE=1` every result carries `opponent_first_factory`, and
`run/batch_curves.py --by-opening` splits the curves by it. Match i plays seed `--seed-base` + i (engine and BARb), and the
two arms of an A/B batch meet the same seeds; the seed does not make BARb repeatable.

Stopping a match by hand: `run/stop_match.py <match or batch dir> [loss|win]` writes a `stop` file the arena's referee
sees within a second; the match is recorded with that outcome (a timeout when none is given, `called: true`) and the
engine is ended with `/kill` like any other, so the replay is written. Do not kill the arena or the engine: the replay
stays at 0 bytes and the record gets no result line (commander-3 and -4 were lost that way).

`run/batch_curves.py <batch dir> [minute ...]` prints a batch's mean curves (extractors, builders, army value, turrets,
ours/theirs) by A/B arm and start corner: the first thing to read after a batch, before the win count.

`run/spot_regret.py <batch or match dir>...` (matches run with `WITHIN_REASON_OBSERVE=1`) classes every metal spot second by
second as ours, theirs, threatened or quiet: extractor-minutes forgone on quiet free ground, and how soon raided ground
is visited again (K-eco-raided-ground-is-raided-again).

`run/analyze_match.py <match dir>` turns a recorded match into what a reader needs to say why it was lost:
- curves for both sides per minute (extractors, builders, army and turret value, factories, our bank and income);
- candidate causes with their numbers (army lead and when it opened, extractor peak and collapse, idle metal and energy
  stalls, metal lost by place, raids, the worst engagement, how many engagements began outnumbered, the commander's death);
- engagements: deaths on both sides clustered in space and time (900 elmos, 20 s), with losses by type and value, where,
  and what each side had on the spot five seconds before, including how spread out our fighters were and turrets present;
- `--engagement N` or `--scene MM:SS X Z`: scene reports, a character map of the ground (water, cliffs) with both sides'
  units as letters (ours lower case, theirs upper case), recent deaths marked, and a legend with counts, classes, health,
  fighting value and our soldiers' roles (home group, attack wave, squad).
Without a truth file the opponent is only what our units saw, and the report says so. The verdict itself is left to
the reader: the tool gives numbers and scenes, not conclusions.

## Calling settled games

The shim logs `balance f=N ours=ARMY/EXTRACTORS theirs=ARMY/EXTRACTORS` every 30 game seconds (soldiers' metal value and
finished extractors, the opponent's read through the cheat callbacks; the bot never sees it). The arena's referee ends
a game as a **called loss** once they have had 3x our army and 3x our extractors for 2 minutes (not before minute 6),
and as a **called win** once we have had 5x their army and 3x their extractors for 5 minutes (not before minute 12):
BARb comes back from early deficits, we do not. Replayed over v17-truth-medium's 24 games the loss rule called 10 of
14 losses 1-16 minutes early and nothing else; the win rule would have called one 40-minute timeout at about minute 29
(67,000 metal of army against 5,900: a game the bot could not finish, which is its own finding). `results.jsonl` marks
such games `"called": true` and the batch summary counts them; `--play-out` disables calling.

**Lockstep (since 2026-09-20).** Every arena game runs the shim with `WITHIN_REASON_LOCKSTEP`: the engine waits for the
bot's answer to each tick. At speed 50 a frame is under a millisecond, so without it any thinking the bot does (the
opening search's half second, a commander's turn) costs game time that it does not cost in a game played at speed 1:
half a second of search was twenty game seconds of a standing commander. Batches before this date ran the heuristic
without it (orders landed a frame or two late, nothing more).

**Think penalty (`--think-penalty X`, default 1 with `--player`, else 0).** Lockstep freezes the world while a player or
commander thinks, which a live game does not: there the picture ages and the orders land late. The penalty puts that
latency back: a turn's outputs (the packet, lists, production, marks, policy changes, footwork, removals; the commander
mode's directives, field orders and wake) are held back X game seconds per wall second the turn took, the old orders
standing meanwhile, and the hands act inside the gap as they would live. So a batch is compressed (speed 50, the
game held) but representative of a real-time game. Every player game before 2026-09-23 15:00 ran without it
(docs/harness/pitfalls.md); pass `--think-penalty 0` to turn it off on purpose, and say so in the ledger row.
**The cap on it (`--think-cap S`, default 7 with `--player`, 0 = none; since 2026-09-27):** a turn's delay is at most S
game seconds, so a provider's slow week does not decide the game while the arena iterates (the user: Opus 5.5's
turns went from 3-6 s to 20 s and back within days). A game before the cap ran uncapped; `batch.json` records
`think_cap`. **The turn limit (`--turn-limit S`, default none):** when the median of the player's last five turns
exceeds S wall seconds the bot writes the match's `stop` file and the arena ends it, undecided and `called`, with the
reason in `results.jsonl` (`reason`) and a `turn_limit` transcript line; one slow turn is not a pattern, five are.

**Tick rate (since 2026-09-20 evening).** The shim sends a tick every 3 frames (10 Hz) for the control lane; the whole
brain still runs every 15. In lockstep that is five times the round trips, each paid in wall time (measured: see the
tick-smoke and tick-cost rows of `docs/experiments.md`). `WITHIN_REASON_TICK_FRAMES=15` in the arena's environment
(the engine inherits it) restores the old rate for a comparison; the value must divide 15. Outside lockstep a slow
answer makes the next tick late rather than dropping it; the record's `late` field and the per-minute `ticks late`
line say how often.

## Placing our commander (`--place`)
With `--place` the arena chooses where our commander spawns inside its box (a 1v1 only): the opening search's best
start (`crates/buildorder/src/start.rs`, ranked first by the user's rule of thumb, within reach of two extractor spots
with a short walk to a third), run from the map as the latest earlier match on it recorded it (its record header, its
`terrain-*.bin`, and the opponent's spawn from its truth file, which must lie in the opponent's box now). The script
then carries `StartPosType=3` with `StartPosX/Z` per team; the opponent keeps the spawn it had. Without it, or when no
such match exists, the game places everyone (`StartPosType=2`) and the log says why. In a game with people the lobby
places an AI, so the bot itself never chooses: it plans from where it stands (the user's ruling, 2026-09-20).

**No rules from the packet (the only mode since 2026-09-27 evening; `--no-rules` from 2026-09-27 morning until then).**
The pianist reads no standing rules out of the packet: the packet is prose in the picture every second, and the
`standing` tool is the one source of rules, whose defaults and pruning are the only ones. The decompression was
deleted after the audit of the eleven games with people (`docs/design/2026-09-27-posing-changes.md` §13b), which had
run it by omission (`run/human_game.sh` never set `WITHIN_REASON_RULES=off`). The `--no-rules` flag is gone with it.

**A packet from a file (`--packet PATH`, since 2026-09-25).** The pianist plays this text as the player's packet for the
whole game when no player is attached (`run/packets/`, the bot's `WITHIN_REASON_PACKET`): the arena instrument for A/Bs
of the hands and the micro lane at Jev's cents a game. (`--opening-plan` went with the bot's own planner the same day;
`run/replay_plan.py` still transcribes a player's opening from a replay into `run/plans/`, as knowledge.)



`--realtime`: speed 1, the engine not in lockstep, the bot in `WITHIN_REASON_REALTIME` (the player's turns and Jev's answers land while the game runs). The rehearsal for a game against people; a 20-minute game is 20 minutes of wall time.
