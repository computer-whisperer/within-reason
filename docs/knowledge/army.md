# Army

### K-army-crowds-are-never-idle
**Claim.** A large group ordered to a rally point is never all idle at once, so "count idle units at the rally point" is a
broken launch condition; group membership has to be tracked explicitly.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19)
**Evidence.** v2-easy-0704/00: army grew to 148 with only 7 waves sent in 35 minutes. After membership-based waves
(v3-easy/03): 8 waves by minute 18.
**Would be wrong if.** (mechanical; would need an engine change)
**Used by.** H-ARMY-WAVES.

### K-army-fighters-before-constructors
**Claim.** The first factory units should be fighters; an opening of several constructors loses the early game to raids.
**Status.** narrowed (2026-09-19): true of five constructors and no fighters, false of two. Against medium, two
constructors before the first fighter cost nothing in army by minute 4 and led by minute 8 (v21-early-expand-ab10, see
K-open-sim-constructors-first). Confounded at the time with K-rules-factory-shift-means-five (both changed in v4).
**Evidence.** v3-easy/04 (5 constructors, 0 army at minute 4, lost) vs v4-easy wins spread over both corners and factions.
**Would be wrong if.** Constructor-first with correct single-unit orders did as well over 24+ matches.
**Used by.** H-PROD-BATCH.

### K-army-piecemeal-midmap
**Claim.** Our waves meet BARb's army in the middle of the map and trade there; reinforcements arrive one by one and die.
**Status.** conjectured (2026-09-19)
**Evidence.** v5-probe/00: attacker centroid stays around (3500-3900, 3700-4300) on a 7168-wide map, attacker count
oscillating 37 -> 20 -> 34 with few idle.
**Would be wrong if.** Attacker positions showed them reaching the enemy base in strength and losing there instead.
**Used by.** (none yet; motivates regrouping before contact)

### K-army-home-defence-does-not-protect-outposts
**Claim.** Keeping the army at home (our default until a wave is ready, or a `defend` stance) does not protect extractors: raids
kill the outer ones, the constructor sent to rebuild dies too, and the economy freezes at 2-3 extractors.
**Status.** conjectured (2026-09-19) — one strategist game plus the medium diagnosis
**Evidence.** opus-first/00 (docs/transcripts/2026-09-19-opus-first.md): 2-3 extractors and +6-9 metal for 20 minutes with 6
turrets and 8-17 idle bots at home; Opus identified it at 4:55, 7:10 and 8:55 and asked for a directive to station the army
at a map point as an escort. Same shape as the v5-medium losses (K-opp-medium-wins-by-20).
**Would be wrong if.** Stationing the home group forward, between the outposts and the enemy, did not raise extractor survival.
**Used by.** (candidate: army `station` directive / forward rally near the most exposed extractor cluster)

### K-army-waves-chased-raiders
**Claim.** Targeting "the visible enemy nearest the enemy start" sends waves to wherever an enemy was last seen, which is
usually a raider inside our own half; the army then spends the game near home.
**Status.** supported as a description of the old behaviour (2026-09-19); the replacement is untested
**Evidence.** dropped-orders-2/00: attacker centroid (2000-2900, 1300-2400) with home at (2032,1188) through minute 20; earlier
batches logged waves launched at (1593,1804), (2326,2943). Replacement: remembered enemy buildings, nearest to us first,
else the presumed enemy start (H-ARMY-TARGET rewritten).
**Would be wrong if.** With building targets the attacker centroid still stayed in our half.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-TARGET.

### K-army-base-maze
**Claim.** Base buildings placed around one anchor with a 3-square (24-elmo) gap form a maze that a T1 army cannot leave:
units fail their moves inside the base, never reach the station, and waves "launch" without going anywhere.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19)
**Evidence.** v10-sites: attackers' average position sat within 350 of our start for 7-15 whole minutes in 6 of 8 NW
games (up to 64 attackers parked). nw-stuck-diag (8 NW games): ~17,000 soldier move failures, all within ~500 of our
start; after the yard layout (nw-layout, 8 NW games) 149, none clustered at home. It did not explain the corner gap
(K-maps-quicksilver-corner-asymmetry). The false alarm it raised: station after station was declared
unreachable (the failing units were in the base, not at the station) until the station fell back to the start point
itself, in the middle of the maze.
**Would be wrong if.** Soldier move failures clustered at home again with the yard layout.
**Used by.** H-ECO-BASE-LAYOUT.

### K-army-dead-waves-are-resurrected
**Claim.** BARb easy builds resurrection bots (armrectr / cornecro) and raises our dead attackers in its half; the units
that finally kill our base are partly our own.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19) — inferred from unit names, not from watching a resurrection
**Evidence.** nw-layout fight ledgers: in all 4 losses the enemy fielded units of OUR faction (7-42 of them killed by us,
2-49 of our losses caused by them); in the 3 wins and the timeout, none. `killed armrectr`, `killed cornecro` appear.
**Would be wrong if.** BARb could build both factions' units by some other route (capture, a shared lab).
**Used by.** (none yet) — candidate: do not feed waves into a defended base; fight where we can reclaim the field.

### K-army-waves-die-to-static-defence
**Claim.** Our waves arrive strung out and die to static defence they never see. In a 40-minute timeout we lost 739
units in the enemy half for 104 kills; 427 of those to attackers we had no sight of, 90 to the enemy commander, 114 to
LLT/HLT/HLLT turrets.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19) — one game read closely (nw-layout match 01), others look alike
**Evidence.** `run/matches/1789857672-nw-layout/01/bot.log` fight ledger.
**Would be wrong if.** Waves gathered at a staging point before engaging lost just as badly.
**Used by.** (none yet) — candidates: gather before the assault, skip targets under turret cover while the army is
small (BARb's own 0.75-power rule), artillery against turrets, a scout for sight.

### K-army-commander-sniped-after-wave-leaves
**Claim.** Many of our losses are not collapses: an enemy group of ~15 walks into a healthy base just after a wave has
left and kills the commander in 10-20 seconds, which ends the game.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19)
**Evidence.** v11-layout match 14: wave 7 (32 units) left at f=34560; at f=36105 the commander had 3535 health, at
f=36495 it was dead to a pack of armwar, with 8 extractors, 4 labs and 28 soldiers alive, 10 of them at home. v10-sites
losses 04, 08, 12: the commander dies at home to corthud / corstorm from under 300 away.
**Would be wrong if.** With H-ARMY-RECALL, losses with a healthy economy (8+ extractors at the end) still happened as often.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-RECALL.

### K-army-we-never-raid
**Claim.** Marching every soldier in one group at one target leaves the enemy's extractors alone all game, while BARb
medium's small fast groups strip ours.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19)
**Evidence.** v13-medium: per game we killed 3.1 enemy extractors from NW and 7.4 from SE, and lost 22.2 and 18.5.
**Would be wrong if.** With raid squads the enemy extractors killed per game did not rise.
**Outcome.** It did not (3.1 -> 4.9, noise): BARb medium guards its extractors with a turret each, and squads of three light
raiders die to them. The claim stands as a description; raiding as a remedy is retired.
**Used by.** (none; H-ARMY-RAID retired)

### K-army-defence-is-positioning-and-mix
**Claim.** In the first Sonnet commander game the loss was mostly defender positioning and unit mix, with a smaller
part played by units that huddled at a cliff edge they could not cross.
**Status.** reported (2026-09-19) by the user from the engine replay (he has StarCraft 2 experience, not BAR).
**Evidence.** `docs/transcripts/2026-09-19-sonnet-commander-1.md`: posts set reactively, after an extractor cluster was
already raided; a posted squad drawn out of its radius; light armpw/armrock/armham against corthud/corstorm. The
huddling predates the terrain work (K-maps-terrain-not-straight-lines): squad posts and orders were straight-line
points, some on the far side of a cliff.
**Would be wrong if.** With posts snapped to walkable ground and a sound mix, the exchange ratio in our half stayed as bad.
**Used by.** (none yet) — positioning and mix are the levers meant for the LLM ([[llm-levers]] in project memory).

### K-army-verdicts-v17
**Claim.** Against BARb medium our losses have two interlocking shapes. (1) Cheap lone raiders (armfav 31 metal, armflash,
corak) farm extractors and constructors while the home group and the turrets stand in one clump at the lab; the bot
rebuilds the same spot into the same raider, up to five times. (2) A wave takes the entire army at a target it has not
weighed, arrives in instalments, dies, and the raid that follows meets nothing at home. Fight quality is secondary:
in two losses the army metal traded 1:1 and the game was still lost on replacement rate (2 extractors against 26).
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19): 14 of 14 losses of one batch, each read by an analyst from curves and scenes; three
claims spot-checked against the raw records by me.
**Evidence.** `run/tally_verdicts.py run/matches/1789868387-v17-truth-medium`: primary cause expansion_raided_undefended 7,
blind_wave_into_defence 3, defenders_out_of_position 3, economy_never_grew 1; defenders_out_of_position contributes in
9 more. Specifics: from the NW start the third and fourth metal spots, (2144,2144) and (2320,2352), lie 963 and 1199
from home, beyond the base turret line (650) and inside OUTPOST_DISTANCE (1200), so no rule ever gives them a turret;
they are the spots killed 3-5 times a game (match 18: 2:44, 5:11, 8:11, 11:50). Recall needs 6 intruders, so a single
raider never triggers it. The wave rule is a head count (20, 25, 30...) that leaves 0 soldiers at home. The
constructor target (3 + extractors/2, earlier 2 + extractors/4) is lowest exactly when extractors are being lost.
In every NW loss "they first have 1.5x our army" falls in minute 6-8, even on level extractors.
**Would be wrong if.** With spots remembered as hot, cover before expansion, a home guard that stays, and a wave gate
on known enemy value, the same tags still led the tally.
**Used by.** (next changes)



### K-army-combat-prediction
**Claim.** Once a fight is decisive (a side with a real force on the spot loses at least half of it), the side with the
higher fighting power, metal value weighted by the duel table with turrets at 3x (1.5x at first: 92 % right; 95 % at
4x, `run/predict_check.py`), loses the smaller share in 9 cases
of 10. The matchup weighting adds only a point or two over plain metal in our games, because both sides field a narrow
set of units. It says nothing about skirmishes and raids, where who loses less is a coin toss (56 %), and nothing about
what we have not seen.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19)
**Evidence.** `run/predict_check.py` over v17-truth-medium and v18-verdict-fixes (48 games): 273 decisive engagements,
89 % right (plain metal 88 %), 93 % beyond 1.5:1, 94 % beyond 2:1, 96 % beyond 3:1; correlation of log power ratio with
log loss-share ratio 0.85. The selection is by outcome (decisive fights only), so this is the accuracy given that a
fight goes to the finish, not the accuracy of "should we start it".
**Would be wrong if.** With retreat and launch decided by these odds, our share of metal lost in their half did not fall.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-WAVE-GATE, H-ARMY-RETREAT, the posted squads' intruder response (`brain/combat.rs`).

### K-army-verdicts-v18
**Claim.** With raided spots closed, turrets on the ring and a wave gate, the lone-raider losses are gone and the bot
reaches minute 10 level; what decides games now is (1) one mobile enemy ball of 700-3000 metal that our split-up
defence meets in packets, (2) a wave gate that weighs only what stands at the target while their army is a roaming
block it has never scouted ("1500 known" against a real 3205), (3) our force arriving in speed order, light raiders
first and rocket infantry 600 elmos behind, so we lose fights we outweigh, (4) constructor attrition: 16-31
constructors lost a game, the bigger bill behind every extractor count, and (5) a far line of spots 2000-2400 from
home bought and swept in every game.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-19): 12 losses of v18-verdict-fixes read by three analysts; the production-stall and
global "turret on its way" bugs they reported were confirmed in the code and logs.
**Evidence.** `run/tally_verdicts.py run/matches/1789870160-v18-verdict-fixes`. Bugs found: the army parked in the lab
yard jams the factory exits (1500 metal banked for five minutes with two labs alive, soldiers' moves failing beside the
base); `unguarded_outpost` treated any turret under construction anywhere as cover for every outpost; the
quiet-at-home clause of the gate never clears under continuous raiding.
**Would be wrong if.** After the fixes (station clear of labs, positional cover test, gate ceiling and remembered
army, scout, expansion reach) the same tags led the next tally.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-STATION, H-ARMY-WAVE-GATE, H-ARMY-SCOUT, H-ECO-REACH, H-ECO-OUTPOST-TURRET.

### K-army-won-games-are-recalled
**Claim.** The south-east timeouts at three to five times the opponent's army were our own retreat rule: it weighed the
handful of attackers in contact against what they met and, finding them outmatched, sent the whole wave home.
**Status.** observed (2026-09-20) in the logs; fix (H-ARMY-REGROUP) unmeasured.
**Evidence.** v26-radar-startguess-ab/03 (timeout, 13,800 v 3,100 army at minute 20): "wave 11: 271 units to (2336,
3008)" at f=67110, then at f=67140 "retreat: 6 attackers at odds 0.60 ...; everyone home"; the same one second after
waves 10 and 12, with 4 and 2 attackers. Every retreat is followed by a 90-second ban on waves.
**Would be wrong if.** With the fix the south-east still times out at the same rate.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-REGROUP.


### K-army-groups-arrive-strung-out
**Claim.** A group given one order strings out by unit speed and meets the enemy a few at a time; the loss happens in
the first seconds of contact, before any judgement can be made.
**Status.** observed repeatedly (2026-09-19/20); the fix (H-ARMY-MARCH) is unmeasured.
**Evidence.** Commander game 8c, 32:09-32:26: 10 Centurions reached the enemy base about 350 elmos ahead of 36 Hammers;
army value fell 9750 to 6930 in 17 seconds. Commander game 6 (lost): three squads ordered to one rally point arrived one
after another and fought alone. v26: waves recalled because the six fastest attackers met something alone
(K-army-won-games-are-recalled). BARb moves a squad on one shared path at its slowest member's speed
(docs/studies/barb-comparison.md).

### K-army-posted-squads-chase-singles
**Claim.** A posted squad that turns, all of it, on the nearest intruder is led around by single cheap units.
**Status.** observed once, from the record (2026-09-20, Opus analyst, code path confirmed).
**Evidence.** Commander game 7/01, 10:02-11:56: one 43-metal Grunt walked all 38 members of `mainforce` from (1485,3376)
to (3528,3027), about 1800 elmos, for 226 metal killed. The post code re-aimed every member at the single nearest
enemy inside the radius every 2 seconds. Now: the biggest group, met by the nearest members good odds take.

### K-army-small-waves-restage-the-army
**Claim.** Re-staging every committed attacker whenever a wave leaves holds the army at the staging point for as long
as small waves keep leaving, which under an `attack` stance (waves of three) is for good.
**Status.** observed once (2026-09-20), commander game 9 south-east (won anyway, by the commander taking the soldiers
into a squad).
**Evidence.** bot.log: wave 1 of 65 at f=28410, then waves 2-27 of 3-4 units about every 15-30 s; attackers 76 -> 101
around (3059, 2995)-(3133, 3108) from f=32400 to f=37800, target 1300 away. The commander's note at 20:44: "stalled
exactly at D4 for many minutes despite attack_target".
**Used by.** H-ARMY-REINFORCE.

### K-team-seats-alone-split-the-army
**Claim.** Two seats of ours that do not talk each hold their own wave against their own target and their own estimate
of the defenders, and neither goes when together they would.
**Status.** observed (2026-09-20), team-2v2-smoke match 0 on Great Divide: both seats held 20-29 soldiers at odds
0.71-1.12 for three minutes against (584, 3592) and (2568, 3592); when they went, they went 2900 frames apart to
different places.
**Evidence.** `run/matches/1789913869-team-2v2-smoke/00/bot.log`, the `wave held` lines from f=20700. With the board
(team-2v2-defend) 12 of 14 waves left within 15-300 frames of the partner's, at the same target.
**Used by.** H-TEAM-BOARD, H-TEAM-WAVES.

### K-team-a-partner-dies-beside-an-idle-army
**Claim.** A seat that only defends its own base and extractors lets its partner be overrun next door.
**Status.** observed once (2026-09-20), team-2v2-board match 0: seat 1 was down to 2 extractors and 2-5 soldiers from
minute 8 with 17-28 enemies in sight, while seat 0 kept 19-26 soldiers at its station 2200 away; lost at 20 minutes.
**Evidence.** `run/matches/1789914072-team-2v2-board/00/bot.log`, the per-minute lines of both seats.
**Used by.** H-TEAM-DEFEND.

### K-army-one-post-for-a-wide-front
**Claim.** A home group that stands on one post cannot answer raids on a wide front: from Quicksilver's north-west start
23 of 24 soldiers stood at one extractor while raiders arrived across 2000 elmos, and 12 of 19 constructor deaths had
nothing of ours within 600.
**Status.** observed (2026-09-20, the early-game post-mortem of commander games 8-11); the remedy (H-ARMY-DETACH) is
built and fires, its own effect is not isolated from the territory grid's.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-DETACH.

### K-army-enemy-army-seen-is-the-worst-estimate-we-have
**Claim.** `enemy_army_seen` — the biggest enemy force in one look within the last two minutes, which the wave gate
uses as its estimate of what our wave will meet — is the worst of the four estimates available to us. Over 430
Quicksilver games its mean absolute error against the opponent's real army metal is 1741; the clock alone scores 1247,
simply summing every enemy soldier ever identified minus the ones we watched die scores 1190, and a fitted model
scores 637. It understates: 2287 against a real 4853 in minutes 20-40. The fault is the two-minute window, not the
measurement — the same sum without the window is the single most informative observation we have (39 % of the
time-only error removed, more than any other feature).
**Status.** measured (2026-09-20), offline; the replacement is unmeasured in the arena.
**Evidence.** `docs/studies/tempo-model.md`, tables "What the bot actually has in hand" and "Held-out error".
`ENEMY_ARMY_MEMORY_FRAMES = 120 s` (`brain/army.rs:62`); the gate at `army.rs:465-478`. This is the mechanism behind
K-army-verdicts-v18's "1500 known against a real 3205".
**Would be wrong if.** With the gate reading an unwindowed sum (or the tempo estimate), waves still launched into
armies they had not counted at the same rate.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-WAVE-GATE (as a criticism of its input, not yet a change).

### K-army-blob-attack-move-wastes-the-raiders
**Claim.** Sending a wave to one point makes it fight as a blob, and a blob is the worst formation our tier-1
raiders can be in. Spreading the same army over a block 110 elmos between neighbours is worth about a fifth of the
metal it trades, and essentially all of that belongs to Pawns and Grunts: over 28 tier-1 pairings in the engine,
metal killed per metal lost went 1.09 to 1.30, with a mean margin gain of +0.47 for Grunt and +0.47 for Pawn
against ±0.05 or less for every other unit. Two mechanisms, not one: the blob feeds two or three units to every
area shell (Mace and Thud 36 elmos, Rocketeer and Aggravator 48), and — the larger effect — a blob of 180-range
raiders cannot get more than its front rank inside its own range of a target, so it walks into a tower line a few
at a time.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-20) in the engine duel harness; **it does not reach the arena** — the
`micro2-spread` A/B is flat (K-army-a-real-wave-is-not-a-blob says why).
**Evidence.** `docs/studies/micro-combat.md`; batches `micro2-off` / `micro2-on` (28 pairings x 6 duels an arm,
equal metal at 1200, spawn spacing 56), compared with `run/duel_ab.py`. Biggest cells: Pawn against Guard −0.182
to +0.570, Grunt against Sentry −0.070 to +0.613. The behaviour was confirmed before the result: `spread_x` in
`duels.csv` (RMS distance of an army's units from its own centre at the first shot) rose from a mean 81 to 131
elmos while the opponent's stayed at 94. Consistent with K-units-duel-spacing-decides-area-damage, measured from
the other end (both sides loose) in the 2026-09-19 tables.
**Retracted from the first pass.** An earlier run of this A/B, on an implementation since corrected, put
Rocketeers against Grunts at −0.254 and it was reported as the policy's one clear cost. Re-run it is −0.056 and
the Rocketeer's row mean is +0.02: six duels a cell cannot separate a fifth of a margin from noise. The engine's
own spacing tables still say spreading hurts that pairing (−0.03 tight against −0.23 wide) and have more duels
behind them, so the question is open, not settled either way. **The raw data of the first pass was lost with the
worktree it lived in and cannot be re-examined.**
**Would be wrong if.** An arena arm with H-MICRO-SPREAD off traded metal at least as well as one with it on, or if
the gain in the duels came from the fight taking longer rather than from the formation (contact time rises with
the spread order and was not separated).
**Used by.** (none; H-MICRO-SPREAD, retired 2026-09-20).

### K-army-withdrawing-a-hurt-soldier-saves-metal-and-loses-the-fight
**Claim.** Walking a unit out of a fight when its health falls below a third is the most metal-efficient policy
tested and still loses ground: over 135 simulated tier-1 cells it took metal killed per metal lost from 1.41 to 2.41
and cost 0.039 of margin. Fewer of ours die; the ones that leave stop shooting, so fewer of theirs die too, and what
walks away walks away hurt. The two measures disagree by exactly the question of whether a hurt soldier is ever
repaired, and ours are not. Only when outnumbered (0.7x metal) is it not negative: +0.005 of margin, 0.66 to 1.02.
**Status.** conjectured (2026-09-20) — simulator only, never run in the engine. It also rests on an unchecked
assumption: that a unit under a `Move` order keeps firing at what comes into range, which is what the engine's
default fire state should do but was not verified.
**Evidence.** `combatsim micro --reps 16`, `docs/studies/micro-combat.md`.
**Would be wrong if.** A duel arm with `withdraw` orders traded better *and* won as often, or if soldiers were
repaired at home, which would move the true measure from margin towards metal.
**Used by.** (candidate: H-MICRO-WITHDRAW, after H-ECO-REPAIR is extended to soldiers)

### K-army-focus-fire-cannot-be-ordered-and-would-not-pay
**Claim.** There is no attack-unit command in the protocol: `Fight` names a point and the engine picks the target,
roughly the nearest. Simulating the command we do not have says not to add it — a side that all shoots the enemy with
the fewest hit points left scores 0.165 of margin *worse* than the engine's own targeting over 135 cells, because
nothing stops a salvo already in the air and the overkill is most of a Rocketeer's 3.8-second volley.
**Status.** conjectured (2026-09-20) — simulator only. The absence of the command was `supported` until 2026-09-20
evening: `Command::Attack` exists now (added for deliberate turret kills, 8ffc510), so the claim is only the second
half, that naive lowest-health focus would not pay; a focus rule that counts damage in the air is H-MICRO-FOCUS's
business (`docs/design/2026-09-20-micro-lane.md`).
**Evidence.** `combatsim micro --reps 16`; `finishing_the_weakest_target_wastes_shots_on_the_dead` in
`crates/combatsim/tests/mechanics.rs`.
**Would be wrong if.** A focus rule that avoided overkill (counting damage already in the air towards a target)
priced out positive; the policy tested is the naive one.
**Used by.** (nothing — it is a reason not to extend the protocol)
**Amended 2026-09-25.** Measured directly in the duel harness (the lane driving one side, 8 duels an arm on the
same sites): H-MICRO-FOCUS cost the Blitz pack against Pawns 0.21 of margin (+0.098 with it, +0.308 without, the
plain order +0.154) and nothing in a 12-against-12 Stout mirror (`docs/studies/2026-09-25-formation-micro.md`); the
rule is retired. The "cannot be ordered" half is stale (the protocol has `Command::Attack`); the "would not pay"
half is supported.

### K-army-a-real-wave-is-not-a-blob
**Claim.** Our waves already fight spread out, so a formation policy has nothing to fix. Measured over the 930
engagements of the `micro2-spread` batch with at least 300 metal of ours present, our soldiers stood at a mean 358
elmos from their own centre with H-MICRO-SPREAD firing 155 times a game and 356 without it — a rule that shapes
every attack order moves the number by two elmos. In the enemy's half, where the army is most concentrated, it
reaches 303 against 270. The duel harness, which spawns an army in ranks 56 apart and sends it at one point,
fights at a mean 81 of the same measure, and the spread orders that beat it by a fifth of the metal traded only
reach 131. **The blob the duel tables price is an artefact of the harness.** By the time a wave is in contact it
has walked a thousand elmos, been marched, regrouped, detached and lost its fastest, and it is three times more
scattered than the formation the policy exists to break up.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-20). Both numbers are the same statistic (RMS distance from the group's own centre):
`present_before.our_fighters_spread` in `run/analyze_match.py --json`, and `spread_x` in the duel harness's
`duels.csv`.
**Evidence.** Batch `micro2-spread` (48 games) against batches `micro2-off` / `micro2-on` (336 duels).
`docs/studies/micro-combat.md`. An earlier, weaker version of this measurement (315 against 325) was taken on a
batch whose raw data has since been lost; this one replaces it and says the same thing with the rule firing
seventeen times as often.
**Would be wrong if.** The arena measure were inflated by the way engagements are cut out (fighters within 1100 of
the centre are counted, so the statistic is bounded well above what was seen — but 327 is far from that bound), or
if waves that arrive together after H-ARMY-MARCH and H-ARMY-STAGE improve showed a lower number.
**Used by.** (none; it explained why retired H-MICRO-SPREAD's engine gain did not reach the arena); a caution for any future
formation or spacing rule priced on the duel tables.

### K-army-distance-decides-a-raid-response
**Claim.** Whether an answer to a raid on an outpost kills anything is decided by where the answer starts from, not by
how big it is: a raider is killed in 79 % of raids when one of ours was within 600 of the extractor ten seconds before
it died, 52 % when the answer came from 600-1500 away, 28 % from beyond 1500 and 23 % when nobody came (the outpost's
turret did it). Parties are not small: 200-1000 metal within 900 of the extractor on average. The chase simulator
reproduces those rates from the units and distances alone (89 / 47 / 23 / 19 %) and agrees with the played outcome in
71 % of single episodes; it under-predicts what our answer loses (304 metal against 506 close by, 89 against 189 from
mid-range) — it knows only the party within 900, not what follows it.
**Status.** measured (2026-09-20), 1106 raids in 48 games (now-quicksilver, now-isidis, now-mithril), medium BARb.
Extractor losses in these episodes are not a fair test of the model: an episode is found by an extractor dying.
**Update 2026-09-20.** With pursuers walking at where their side last saw the party (not at where it is), the same episodes predict 83 / 39 / 22 / 19 %: nearer the played 79 % from within 600, farther from the played 52 % from 600-1500, where play has the team's whole sight and radar to re-order by and the scenario has only the units in it.
**Evidence.** `run/raid_episodes.py <batches>`, `combatsim chase-file`, `run/raid_episodes.py --compare`.
**Would be wrong if.** Episodes found another way (every party that came within 900 of an extractor, died or not) gave
different rates by distance.
**Used by.** H-ARMY-CONTACT (`docs/design/2026-09-20-army-response.md`): answer from near or not
at all, guard where parties go, and price the answer's own losses higher than the model says.

### K-micro-a-tick-is-a-tower-margin
**Claim.** At the 2 Hz tick a Pawn (87 elmos a second) walks 43 elmos between decisions, most of the 90-elmo margin
between "outside a light laser tower's reach" and "dying in it" (reach 430, 160 damage a second against 370 health;
the commander 300 and about 390 a second); at 10 Hz it walks 9. So no rule at 2 Hz can keep a Pawn out of a defence it
did not mean to enter, and the four raid faults found on 2026-09-20 (the dive at the commander after sighting it, the
fight under a tower with no flee, the leader waiting for joiners under fire, the party walked through the base on a
Move) are all decisions taken too late at the unit level.
**Status.** supported (2026-09-20 evening) on the mechanism measures: micro-ab2 (12 games an arm, the whole lane)
by minute 20 cut deaths to turrets and the commander from 10.9 to 4.9 a game and the exchange from 1.27 to 0.78, and
won 3 to 0 (wins alone are within noise at this size). First A/B (micro-flee-ab, 12 games an arm): the flee alone cut deaths to turrets and the commander from 4.2 to 3.2 a game by minute 10 and soldier-seconds
under fire from 328 to 216, but also halved what the army killed (648 against 1174) because wounded units left unit
fights their side was winning; wins 1 against 3. The claim stands for static defences; for unit fights it is
K-army-withdrawing-a-hurt-soldier-saves-metal-and-loses-the-fight that holds, and the rule now leaves only losing fights.
**Evidence.** `crates/combatsim/data/units.json` (armpw, armllt, armcom); rush-26 records: 17.8 Pawns lost to 3.0
buildings killed by minute 10; micro-flee-debug (one game, the first lane): every Pawn death traced to a decision the
lane made or failed to make (`docs/design/2026-09-20-micro-lane.md`, status).
**Would be wrong if.** The lane's A/B (`--ab-disable H-MICRO-LANE`, 24 games) showed no fall in soldiers lost to
turrets and the commander, or in soldier-seconds under fire (`run/micro_ledger.py`).
**Amended 2026-09-25 (lane-ab, 24 games an arm on Comet Catcher against medium, the heuristic bot).** By this
claim's own test the lane no longer shows: deaths to turrets or the commander 6.2 a game with the final lane, 5.4
with the old, 5.2 without; soldier-seconds under fire 1,741 / 1,731 / 1,655. What the lane shows instead is the
trade: metal lost per metal killed 0.79 [0.65-0.95] against 0.94 [0.83-1.05] without, deaths elsewhere 36 against
45, muzzled 6.4% against 11.5%, spacing at contact 51 against 40. The tower margin is what the flee was built on;
on this map against medium the fights are unit fights (the raid's turret dives are Quicksilver's), and the flee's
tower cases are few (0.4 deaths in reach a game by minute 10). The claim stands for what it measured (the 10 Hz
margin at a tower); its "would be wrong if" no longer separates the lane from no lane here.
**Used by.** H-MICRO-LANE, H-MICRO-FLEE.

### K-micro-a-hunt-by-id-catches-a-raider
**Claim.** A raider is caught by hunters faster than it when the order is an attack on its unit id re-issued every
tick with no footwork over it (H-MICRO-HUNT), and not by a fight-to-point at its last place re-issued every two seconds
(the hands' engage before 2026-09-26): the point is where the raider was, the attack is where it is.
**Status.** measured (2026-09-26) in the duel harness's raid scenario (`duel --scenario raid`, `docs/harness/duels.md`):
four Rovers and two Blitzes at a station in the middle of a strip of four extractors 600 apart, a Tick and a Pawn on a
scripted route that runs from anything within 350; the picket answers by the standing raider rule (two pickets faster
than the raider, at a raider within 250 of a building of ours and 1,200 of the station), the same ends judged either
way (dead, out of sight 6 s, a 900 leash from where the hunt began, a third of health).
**Evidence.** raid-on-8 and raid-on-8b (16 raids, the hunt): the first raider killed at a median 11.0 s from the first
orders (11 s in ten of sixteen; 17-33 s in the rest, when the Rovers' first hunt on the Tick ended by the leash or both
Rovers dropped hurt under the Pawn's gun), both raiders dead in 15 of 16 by 22-72 s, extractors lost 0.19 a raid (0 in
14), hunters lost 1.3 (Rovers to the Pawn). raid-off-8 and raid-off-8b (16 raids, fight-to-point every 2 s): the first
kill at a median 76 s (23.7-150.8), both raiders dead in 6 of 16, ten raids to the 180 s cap with a raider alive,
extractors lost 1.25 a raid, hunters lost 1.3. The hunts' ends show the mechanism: with the hunt a run ends "dead" in
1 s after the hunters reach the quarry; without it the runs end "leash" 6-15 s after they begin, eight to sixteen
times a raid, the hunters running to where the raider was. The 900 leash from the hunters' start ends the first hunt
on the far extractor (1,060 from the station) either way; the second hunt, from where they then stand, catches it.
**Would be wrong if.** The fight-to-point arm reached the first kill as soon on the same raids, or the hunt arm lost
more extractors.
**Used by.** H-MICRO-HUNT; `docs/design/2026-09-26-threat-response.md` (ladder step 1).

### K-micro-a-unit-under-the-guns-shoots
**Claim.** A soldier already inside the enemy's reach should stay and shoot even when their fire on it would kill it
and its side is locally outgunned: a unit that walks does not fire, and their fire on a ball at contact is "lethal"
for every unit in it at once. The lethal flee is for the unit on its way into a losing fight, judged by strength
(damage a second times health), not by damage a second.
**Status.** measured (2026-09-25) in the duel harness with the lane driving one side (`duel --lane old`, one site,
`WITHIN_REASON_MICRO_DEBUG` naming what held each muzzled unit). 11 Blitzes against 22 Pawns: the lethal flee as
written on 2026-09-20 (damage a second odds, no "inside" test) fled seven to ten Blitzes at contact in a fight the
plain order wins (+0.26, 0% muzzled): 24-33% of the Blitzes' in-reach seconds muzzled, 21 of 36 muzzled seconds
under the flee claim (form-smoke-old, -old3). With strength odds alone it still fled hurt units before contact
(form-smoke-old3); with the inside test as well, 0% muzzled (form-smoke-old4), and over 8 duels the amended branch
costs nothing measurable beside the formation (form4-blitz-on-nofocus +0.308 +- 0.023 with it, form3-blitz-on
+0.282 +- 0.018 without).
**Evidence.** `docs/studies/2026-09-25-formation-micro.md`; the debug lines `muzzled: ... held by H-MICRO-FLEE`.
**Would be wrong if.** An arena A/B with the inside test showed more soldiers lost to unit fights the side was losing
than without it over 24 games.
**Used by.** H-MICRO-FLEE.

### K-army-pickets-across-the-front
**Claim.** Tick and scout-car raids on the outer extractors are standard and expected (BARb from about 5:00 on Comet
Catcher, outermost spots first), so the answer is decided before they come: single soldiers or pairs standing across
the front at each outer spot cluster, told to attack on sight, answer a raider in seconds; a guard at home sent after
the extractor is attacked arrives after it is gone. One responding unit is enough for a single Tick; more is wasted
and pulls the group about.
**Status.** stated by the user 2026-09-22 late, watching escalate-4-hard-aggressive; not measured over games.
**Evidence.** `run/matches/1790125719-escalate-4-hard-aggressive`: 33 extractors lost, most to single Ticks at spots no
soldier stood near while the Blitzes held as a guard group at home or at spot_43 (the player's notes 5:19, 10:00); the
experienced players' game lost one extractor in seven minutes with a light turret beside each pair.
**Would be wrong if.** Pickets of one across the front lost as many extractors to Ticks as the home guard did, or died
in numbers to the parties that follow the Ticks.
**Used by.** H-HANDS-DETACH (`how_many` 1), the player's guide and brief (pickets from the first Blitzes).

### K-army-air-plant-seen-means-aa
**Claim.** An enemy Aircraft Plant in sight is the whole warning: its first gunship is about ninety seconds behind
it, tier-1 tanks and bots do a fifth of their damage to it and only when the ground is clear, and an 80-metal Nettle
beside each pair of extractors or Whistlers in the plant before it arrives is the answer; after it arrives the
extractors are already gone.
**Status.** stated by the user 2026-09-23 ("WReason should have noticed the air lab I was building, and could have
countered the build directly"); one game.
**Evidence.** `run/matches/1790132629-human-9`: the plant seen at 2:16, reported as a grid without its type, the first Banshee at 3:54, Nettles
from 4:42, eight Blitzes to six Banshees at 8:22.
**Would be wrong if.** Nettles at the extractors from the sighting still lost them to gunships, or the plant were
seen and no aircraft came in a run of games.

## Comet Catcher Remake 1.8: the replay survey (2026-09-23)

Claims from the game cards of 29 public 1v1 duels (both players OS 25 and above, games of 2026-09-20 to 2026-09-23 on BAR test-31357 to 31383), filed by the synthesis agent against `docs/knowledge/questions.md` and checked with `run/replays/check.py`; the map file `docs/knowledge/maps/comet_catcher_remake_1.8.md` and the index `docs/knowledge/replays.md` point here. Spot numbers are the cards' (the game's own 80-spot list), not the bot's (the engine's 75); they map to the bot's by position (nearest within 130), and every spot carries its grid cell (8x8 over 8192x6144). Unit names: armfav Rover, corfav Rascal, armflash Blitz, corgator Incisor, corak Grunt, armpw Pawn, armflea Tick, armstump Stout, corraid Brute, armllt/corllt the light laser turret. "W"/"L" are the winners' and the losers' sides. Remaining card limits: `fights` is the eight costliest cell-minutes per game; the cards carry no unit positions over time (held back or chasing cannot be read); the killer of the first extractor is "?" on 10 sides; one manifest start (bcaeb16a, Chronopolize) disagrees with the card's B5 and the card is used. Fixed after the survey (cards re-cut 2026-09-23 evening): the faction field, the spots' cells, the first-enemy-seen field (removed: a replay sees everything), the factories' order, the last 15 s of kills counted apart, cells on every building, the first tier-2 unit.

### K-army-comet-raiders-to-12
**Claim.** Tier-1 raiders are the army through 12:00. Armada sides (average per side): 3.1 Rovers and 0.7 Blitz at 2:00
(25 sides), 5.2 Rovers and 3.6 Blitz at 4:00, 8.1 Blitz and 3.6 Rovers at 6:00, 13.1 Blitz at 8:00 (21), 17.3 at 10:00
(18), 24.1 at 12:00 (15). Cortex: 2.4 Rascals at 2:00 (33), 4.4 Grunts, 4.2 Rascals, 2.5 Incisors at 4:00, 7.2 Incisors
and 6.1 Grunts at 6:00, 13.2 Incisors at 8:00 (29), 19.8 at 10:00 (26), 25.6 at 12:00 (21). Line units (Stout, Brute,
Thud, Pounder, Janus, artillery) were in 5 of 25 winners' armies at 8:00, 11 of 22 at 10:00, 10 of 18 at 12:00, at a
median 3% of the count at 12:00; Brutes first appear at 10:00 (median, 17 Cortex sides) and Stouts at 12:00 (7 Armada
sides). Scout cars fall from the lead unit at 2:00-4:00 to under three per side from 8:00 (Rascals under one).
**Status.** observed (2026-09-23, replay survey)
**Evidence.** all 29 (`army_by_type` every two minutes).
**Would be wrong if.** Games on a later version with line units by 8:00 in most sides. **Refines**
K-open-comet-flash-raids-take-the-resign: the Blitz (and the Incisor for Cortex) is the army all game, not only the
opening. What beats what cannot be read from the cards: kills and losses are whole-game totals by type; a per-fight
composition (the types dying on each side in each fight cell) would answer it.
