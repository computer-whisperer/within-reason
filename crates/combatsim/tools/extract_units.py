"""Derive data/units.json from the game's unit definition files (only the numbers combat needs are copied).

usage: tools/extract_units.py <path to Beyond-All-Reason checkout> > data/units.json

A unit file is a pure Lua data table (`return { name = {...} }`), so it is loaded with `lua` and serialised to JSON
rather than scraped with regexes: weapondefs are nested three deep and the fields we need vary by weapon type.
Only the files listed below are loaded, and nothing else in the checkout is executed.

Post-processing (`gamedata/alldefs_post.lua`) is applied here where it changes combat numbers with the arena's
default mod options (every `multiplier_*` is 1): reload and burst times are rounded down to whole engine frames,
and a BeamLaser with `impactonly` becomes areaofeffect 11 / edgeeffectiveness 1. Nothing else in `_post` touches
health, damage, range or speed; the rest is graphics, mod options and categories.
