//! Combat prediction: who wins if these two forces fight it out, from metal value and the duel table
//! (`docs/harness/duels.md`). Checked against 273 decisive engagements of recorded games
//! (`run/predict_check.py`): the side given the higher power lost the smaller share of its force in 89 % of them, 94 %
//! when the ratio was beyond 2:1. Plain metal value does nearly as well (88 %); the matchup weighting matters when
//! the two sides field different kinds of unit. What it cannot know is what we have not seen.
