//! The control lane: what a soldier does with its order between the brain's decisions, every tick
//! (`docs/design/2026-09-20-micro-lane.md`). The brain (`think`) decides intent and gives orders; the lane may
//! override a unit's order for as long as a behaviour claims it, and gives the order back when none does. It never
//! chooses a target or re-prices a fight: it spends a unit's order on staying alive.
//!
//! H-MICRO-LANE switches the whole lane off; each behaviour has its own ID under it.
