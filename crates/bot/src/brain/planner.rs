//! The rolling-horizon economy planner (`docs/design/2026-09-21-rolling-planner.md`). H-OPEN-SEARCH searches a plan
//! (`buildorder::plan::Plan`: one queue for the commander, one per factory, one per constructor) from a snapshot of
//! the game on its own thread, ten minutes ahead, again every `PLAN_INTERVAL_FRAMES` and whenever a builder or
//! factory of ours comes or goes; H-OPEN-PLAN has each builder work through its queue when idle, ahead of the
//! rules, which take a builder whose queue has run out. The plan ends only with the commander.
//!
//! The first search of a game blocks the tick (the engine takes no orders in the opening seconds anyway); the later
//! ones run beside the game and are re-based on what each builder began while they ran.
