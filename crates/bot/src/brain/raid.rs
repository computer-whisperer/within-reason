//! five to twelve Pawns at the opponent's base before 2:30, and against BARb medium that is the game. Raiders that find
//! no army at the opponent's base go for its commander and its lab, and the home group is committed after them
//! (H-ARMY-KILL; `docs/design/2026-09-20-rush-benchmark.md`).

//! judged by the duel table; and before it H-ARMY-RAID, whose fast raiders died to the turret BARb puts beside nearly
//! every extractor. With a commander present the ground is its to raid; it is shown the same targets in its report.
